nurserysizecharts
=================

Generate charts of SpiderMonkey nursery size and tenure rate for while running
various benchmarks.

This uses logs files generated by running with the JS_GC_PROFILE_NURSERY=0
environment variable.  These are stored in the results directory.  Charts are
generated by running make:

 $ make

Talos benchmarks can be run automatically on builds symlinked into the builds
directory:

 $ make -f Makefile-runBenchmarks
